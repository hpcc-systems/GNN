/**
  * Test GNNI with a classic classification neural network.
  * This test uses synthetic data generated internally.
  * It shows how GNN is used for classification using a simple
  * 2 dimensional (classic) input and output.
  * GNNI supports NumericField matrices as input and output
  * for 2D problems, as well as the more flexible Tensor
  * input and output.
  * This test (arbitrarily) uses NumericField I/O instead of
  * Tensors in order to validate and illustrate this capability.
  * It could have used 2D Tensors.  Use of 2D Tensors is
  * demonstrated in ClassicTest.ecl.
  * For a classification example using higher dimensional tensors
  * and more complex neural networks, see:
  * HARTests/harLSTM.ecl or HARTests/harCNN_LSTM.ecl.
  * These examples also illustrate how to use the one-hot encoding
  * / decoding utilities.
